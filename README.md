Technologies used:
Document type is HTML. Coded in Javascript and Jquery, styled with CSS.
Most of the document's code is written in jquery, although at times vanilla javascript is used to perform actions which are arbitrarily understood with jquery. CSS styling is done mostly on style sheet, although also done in jquery at times. 




Approach taken:
Created buttons which reveal certain texts upon click. When clicked, other text that was visible then becomes hidden. Rising sun was created by creating a round border radius in CSS and providing it with a keyframe animation. Audio was included upon button-click by inserting audio link. Used hexadeimal values and google fonts for colors and font-styles. Provided hyperlinkss for various websites to visit upon button click. Experimented with when to use div, versus when to use other elements for the sake of organizational workflow. Flexbox also used for the purpose of positioning. 


Unresolved issues: 
One of the points of interactions provided was playing audio upon click of the bio button. This works locally for me, but once deployed to site, audio function does not work. It seems that my code is very repetitive and can definitely be written in a more optimized way. Need much more work done on implementing responsive design - don't quite understand how to do that part. I would like to contribute many more changes to this, such as design decoration, animations, and more user activity. I provided an email submission box, but it does not do anything when the user submits.
